</p>Ah yeah a construction site! It took me way</p>
</p>too long to find it. As you can see these are</p>
</p>skeletons of a never completed cabins and not</p>
</p>much else but these are neat to look at though.</p>
</p>Even caught a fellow exploer while taking this</p>
</p> picture. Didn't get to talk as they just left.</p>

</p>I'm outside a forest 5 miles away from</p>
</p>my appartment. Acording to an old book</p>
</p>at the library there were plans to build</p>
</p>a summer camp but it was never completed</p>
</p>for unknown reasons. I'm going to find it.</p>
