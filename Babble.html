 <p>I'm on the bus home but I can't get what just</p>
 <p>happened out of my head. He saw my latest post</p> 
 <p>and just looked me dead in the eye and asked if </p>
 <p>the woman in the picture saw me. I told him that</p>
 <p>she turned her head and left the moment I tried</p>
 <p>to talk to her. His face went pale."Stay here,</p>
 <p>I need to get you help." He walked away and </p>
 <p>hadn't returned in two hours. It was strange</p>
 <p>but I got his number so I'll 'ask him why he</p>
 <p>just left on a cryptic note when I get home.</p>

 <p> lone table so someone let me sit at thier table.</p>

 <p>We talked and started to bond. He let me take this</p>
 <p>picture so I showed him my blog. He's impressed by</p>
 <p>the amount of places I've found and is asking me</p>
 <p>lots of questions. I havn't felt something like </p>
 <p>this nice since kindergarden. I think I finally</p>
